## Abstract

In this study, we explore a comprehensive range of machine learning models for demand forecasting using historical sales data. Our primary objective is to predict weekly sales for the upcoming period by leveraging various features extracted from the data. We utilize methods including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Bagging, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), LightGBM, and CatBoost. The performance of these models is evaluated based on their RÂ² scores, with the aim of identifying the most effective model for accurate sales prediction. The study provides a comparative analysis of these models, highlighting their strengths and limitations.
